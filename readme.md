## 🧠 Core Logic & Learning Outcomes
In this project, I implemented the following programming concepts:
1.  **Event Listeners:** Used `addEventListener` to capture user interactions like clicks and form submissions.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Captured `value` from input fields.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Applied `if-else` blocks to verify PIN codes and ensure the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance.
4.  **DOM Updating:** Dynamically updated the `innerText` of balance elements to reflect real-time changes to the user.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Transaction History:** A log to track every deposit and withdrawal.
- [ ] **Input Validation:** Better error messaging for empty fields or invalid PINs.
